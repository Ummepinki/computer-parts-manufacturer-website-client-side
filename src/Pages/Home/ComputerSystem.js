                    <p>A Computer system is defined as combination of components designed to process data and store files.
                        A computer system requires hardware software and a user to fully function .
                        Computer systems are currently built around at least one digital processing device. There are five main hardware components in a computer system: Input, Processing, Storage, Output and Communication devices.   </p>
